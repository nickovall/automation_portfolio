# Automation Portfolio

This repository contains example projects for an automation specialist role. Each project
demonstrates the use of no-code tools (e.g., n8n) and simple code snippets for integrating
business processes.

## Projects
- **Lead Intake & Dedup Pipeline**: Automates lead capture, validation, deduplication,
  and notification.
- **Support Ticket Triage with LLM**: Uses a large language model to classify and route
  support tickets.
- **Invoice and Payment Reminder Automation**: Automates sending reminders for unpaid
  invoices and generates summary reports.

Each project includes a detailed README explaining its purpose, key features, and steps
for setup and usage.
